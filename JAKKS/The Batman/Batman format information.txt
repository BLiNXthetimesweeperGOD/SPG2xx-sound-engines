Song table offset:
0x1D85D8 (there's 10 songs, everything before this appears to be sound effects)
Pointers must be multiplied by 2 to get the true offsets. The same thing applies to the next section.

Sequence index table format:
XXXX - Unsigned integer for channel count
YYYY - Unknown (skip this one, the format will parse fine without it)
ZZZZZZZZ - Sequence offset (repeat for however many channels there are)

Sequence format:
This format is little endian. XXYY is actually stored as YYXX (but is read as XXYY).
XXYY - Note (X is the note, Y is the length of the note. Notes are limited to a range between 00 and 7F.)
XXFF - ? (no idea what this does, appears often though. The value of XX can vary, but the second byte is always FF)
B0XX - Program change (XX is the instrument ID)
F000 - End of track
