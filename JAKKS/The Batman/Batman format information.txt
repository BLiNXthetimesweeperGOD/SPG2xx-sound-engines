Song table offset:
0x1D85D8 (there's 10 songs, everything before this appears to be sound effects)
Pointers must be multiplied by 2 to get the true offsets. The same thing applies to the next section.

Sequence index table format:
XXXX - Unsigned integer for channel count
YYYY - Unknown (skip this one, the format will parse fine without it)
ZZZZZZZZ - Sequence offset (repeat for however many channels there are)

Sequence format:
This format is little endian. XXYY is actually stored as YYXX (but is read as XXYY).
XXYY - Note (X is the note, Y is the length of the note. Notes are limited to a range between 00 and 7F.)
XXFF - ? (no idea what this does, appears often though. The value of XX can vary, but the second byte is always FF)
B0XX - Program change (XX is the instrument ID)
F000 - End of track

Using the Python scripts:
Run BatmanExtractor on your The Batman ROM and run the conversion script before selecting all 4 channels for the song you wish to convert to MIDI. Only select files that are greater than 0 kilobytes! Anything that's 0 KB will fail to convert because it's an invalid file. The conversion script requires MIDO to work, so be sure to run "pip install mido" before running it.
